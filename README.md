<h2 align="left">👩‍💻 About me </h2>

<p align="justify">
Hello, my name is Victor. I am a Data Engineer with a strong background in analytics and business intelligence, specializing in building reliable, scalable, and well-structured data platforms that support advanced reporting and data-driven decision-making.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My core technical expertise includes SQL and Python, which I use extensively for data modeling, transformation, validation. Additionally, I work with Apache Spark (namely PySpark) to process large-scale datasets efficiently, designing distributed data pipelines that handle both batch and incremental workloads. I have hands-on experience orchestrating data workflows using Apache Airflow, where I design maintainable DAGs, implement monitoring and alerting, and ensure reliable scheduling and dependency management across multiple data sources and downstream systems.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have Hands-on experience with semantic web technologies, particularly RDF-based data modeling and ontology development. Skilled in writing SPARQL queries to efficiently query, integrate, and federate data from RDF graphs.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition to data engineering, I bring strong data analytics and business intelligence expertise. I have significant experience with Power BI, where I develop semantic models, dashboards, and reports that translate complex data into actionable insights for business stakeholders. This dual background allows me to design data platforms that are not only technically robust but also highly effective for downstream analytics and reporting use cases.

<b> Superstore Sales Analysis </b>
</p>

<p align="justify">
   The main goal of Superstore Data Analysis is to thoroughly explore the dataset, provide valuable insights into Superstore's sales performance, highlighting areas of strength and weakness and identify areas for the continued success and refinement of the Superstore. The dataset contains a wide range of information about sales transactions, customers, products, and geographical locations. 
   The analysis includes several key metrics, such as sales revenue, profit, as well as explores trends in sales over time, product categories and sub-cateories, customer segments, shipping modes, and geographical regions. 
   The data was analyzed and visualized using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn Plotly) in Jupyter Lab.

<b> Bike-Stores </b>
</p>

<p align="justify">
   The main objective of the project was to gain valuable insights into various aspects of bicycle store operations, including customer behavior, employee achievements, brand and category characteristics, geographic features, annual and monthly revenues.
   Each table of the database includes various information about customers, orders, staff, stores, brands, categories, products and stocks. The main analysis was performed by MySQL.
   To complement the detailed SQL analysis, I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides dynamic visualizations of key metrics such as total sales, total quantity, total orders and total stocks.
